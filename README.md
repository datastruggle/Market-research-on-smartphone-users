# Market-research-on-smartphone-users
# About the dataset
We have collected data from around 286 responders using Google form. The data collected icluded people from age of 15 to age of 70. The gender ratio of male to female in the collected data is around 1.64. We mainly followed snowball and convenience non probalistic sampling method to collect the data.
# Objective
This project is an attempt to analyze Indian Smartphone users so that our research findings can be used by relevant organizations to improve their existing products and as well will help them to launch new products suited for our Indian market.
# Data preprocessing 
Some of the columns like email-id, Timestamp are dropped from the dataset. Missing categorical values are replaced with mode and otliers in the dataset are removed using IQR(Interquartile range). We divided the dataset into two age groups one above 30 and the other one less than equal to 30  
# Conclusions
# For age <= 30

There is very weak correlation between Age, Buying capacity, Buying cycle.

Both females and males in equal propotions are preferring to buy from physical stores. If the preferrence of the buying window is arranged in a descending order this what we get :
Physical stores > Flipkart > Amazon > Others

Around 67 percent of all the people who are buying android phones belong to the income bracket of 15000 to 30000
For IOS users the figures are a bit different, about 36 percent of the total IOS users fall in the income bracket of 15000 to 30000. 
People belonging to this income bracket are also the highest contributor in each of these categories. 

Most of the people are preferring a battery backup between 12-16 hrs. 
We can also say that while buying a smartphone the combination of 12-16 hours of battery backup with a RAM of 8 GB is mostly preferred by our responders. 

# For age > 30

If we compare the data for the preference of buying window with the people of age <= 30 . There is slight difference here for the people belonging from this age group, they are preferring more to buy from amazon than flipkart. If we arrnage the preferences in a descending order this is what we get :
Physical stores > Amazon > Flipkart > Others

Around 36 percent of all the people who are buying android phones belong to the income bracket of 15000 to 30000
For IOS users the figures are slightly different, about 33 percent of the total IOS users fall in the income bracket of 15000 to 30000. 
The IOS users in same numbers are coming from three income brackets 15000 to 30000, above 75000 and 30000 to 45000 .

Most of the people of this age group are preferring a battery backup of more than 20 hours. 
If we arrange the preference of battery backup in a descending order, then we will get it as follows:
       Above 20 > 16-20> 12-16> 8-12> 4-8

preferred combinations:
Above 20 hours and 8GB of ram

16-20 hours of battery back up and 8 GB ram

12-16 hours of battery backup and 12 gab rams.

# For the whole sample

Processor is the most important buying factor and if we arrange the buying factors in a descending order we will get as follows:
Processor > Storage space > Price> Camera> RAM> Looks

SAMSUNG stands out be the most preferred brand. If we arrange the brand preferences in a descending order the order will be as follows:
SAMSUNG > ONEPLUS > XIAOMI > APPLE = OTHERS

Personal use and Photography come out to be the most important purpose for buying a smartphone.
